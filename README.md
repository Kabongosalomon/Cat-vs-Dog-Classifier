# Cat-vs-Dog-Classifier
Create an algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats

## Problem description
In this problem we will write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  This is easy for humans. We will in this project make our computers able to do this kind of classification.
